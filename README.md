## 1. Overview

The provided code is a **Tic-Tac-Toe** game written in JavaScript, relying on DOM operations to:

- Display **status messages** (e.g., whose turn it is, who won, or if it’s a draw).
- Listen for **click events** on each cell of the 3x3 board.
- Switch between **Player X** and **Player O**.
- Check for a **win** or **draw** state.
- **Restart** the game when requested.

Although the code interacts with certain DOM elements (like `document.querySelector`, `document.querySelectorAll`), these steps will focus on **how the logic works** rather than detailing specific HTML or CSS.

## 2. Review the Code Structure

Open the `.js` file containing the Tic-Tac-Toe logic (for reference, the code you provided):

1. **Global Variables and Constants**:

   - `gameActive`: A boolean to track whether a game is still in progress.
   - `currentPlayer`: A variable set to either `"X"` or `"O"`.
   - `gameState`: An array of nine strings (initially empty), representing the cells of the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
   - `winningConditions`: An array of arrays, each sub-array describing a set of indices that would constitute a win (e.g. `[0,1,2]` for the top row).

2. **Functions**:

   - `currentPlayerTurn()`: Returns a string indicating whose turn it is.
   - `handleCellPlayed(clickedCell, clickedCellIndex)`: Updates the `gameState` and the clicked cell.
   - `handlePlayerChange()`: Switches from `"X"` to `"O"` or vice versa.
   - `handleResultValidation()`: Checks if the current move resulted in a win or draw. Updates messages and `gameActive` accordingly.
   - `handleCellClick(clickedCellEvent)`: Main function triggered by a cell click. Determines which cell was clicked and calls the relevant logic.
   - `handleRestartGame()`: Resets variables and clears the board for a new game.

3. **Event Listeners**:
   - **Cells**: Each cell listens for a `"click"` event and calls `handleCellClick()`.
   - **Restart Button**: Listens for a click to trigger `handleRestartGame()`.

---

## 3. Configure and Initialize Variables

1. **Confirm the Initial States**:

   - `gameActive = true;` ensures the game is ready to receive moves.
   - `currentPlayer = "X";` sets which player starts.
   - `gameState = ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""];` ensures the board is empty at the beginning.

2. **Set Up the Status Message** (optional in code logic):

   - `statusDisplay.innerHTML = currentPlayerTurn();`  
     This snippet updates a DOM element (stored in `statusDisplay`) to show the initial message, `"It's X's turn"`.

3. **Rely on `winningConditions`** to define possible winning lines:
   - Each sub-array (e.g. `[0, 1, 2]`) corresponds to a row, column, or diagonal.

---

## 4. Handle Cell Clicks

- The `handleCellClick(clickedCellEvent)` function is attached to each cell in the grid.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Identify which DOM cell was clicked (`clickedCell = clickedCellEvent.target`).
  2. Extract its index (`clickedCellIndex = parseInt(...)`).
  3. Check if the game is still active (`gameActive` is true) and if the cell is unused (`gameState[clickedCellIndex]` is empty).
  4. If valid, call `handleCellPlayed(clickedCell, clickedCellIndex)` to:
     - Update `gameState[clickedCellIndex] = currentPlayer`.
     - Display the current player’s symbol inside the cell.
  5. Next, call `handleResultValidation()` to see if a win or draw has occurred.

---

## 5. Implement Game Logic

### 5.1 Win Checking

- `handleResultValidation()` loops through every **winning condition**:
  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {
    const winCondition = winningConditions[i];
    // ...
    if (a === b && b === c) {
      roundWon = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  ```
````

- It extracts the three indices from the `winningConditions` array.
- Checks if `gameState[posA]`, `gameState[posB]`, and `gameState[posC]` are non-empty and identical.
- If they match, a player has won.

### 5.2 Draw Checking

- After checking for a win, the code checks if `gameState` has no empty strings:
  ```js
  let roundDraw = !gameState.includes("");
  if (roundDraw) {
    // ...
  }
  ```
  - `!gameState.includes("")` returns `true` if every position is filled.

### 5.3 Ending the Round

- If `roundWon` or `roundDraw` is detected:
  - The code updates the message to declare the result.
  - `gameActive = false;` is set, stopping further input.

### 5.4 Switching Player

- If there is no win or draw, `handlePlayerChange()` toggles `currentPlayer` from `"X"` to `"O"` or vice versa.

## 6. Enable Restart Functionality

When the restart function `handleRestartGame()` is called:

1. **Reset `gameActive`** to `true`.
2. **Set `currentPlayer`** back to `"X"`.
3. **Clear `gameState`**: `["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]`.
4. **Clear the visual board** (i.e., any DOM cells get their content reset to an empty string).
5. **Update the status message** to `"It's X's turn"`.

This ensures the code returns to a fresh state, allowing a new game to start.

---

## 7. Run and Verify

1. **Load/Run the Code** in an environment that includes:

   - A script or testing environment that can access `document.querySelector` and `document.querySelectorAll`.
   - Elements for `.cell`, `.game--status`, and `.game--restart`.

2. **Click on Cells**:

   - Verify that the first click places `"X"`, and the status changes to indicate `"O"`'s turn.
   - Continue clicking. Confirm the logic tracks each player, checks for wins, and updates the message appropriately.

3. **Try a Winning Move**:

   - Arrange so that three same symbols align.
   - The code should declare the winner and set `gameActive = false`, preventing further moves.

4. **Attempt a Draw**:

   - Fill all 9 cells without forming a winning line.
   - The code should announce a draw.

5. **Restart**:
   - Click the restart button to ensure the board resets and the game state is cleared.

---

## 8. Suggested Customizations

- **Score Keeping**: Track how many games X or O has won overall.
- **Sound Effects**: Add a beep or click sound for each move or a cheer on winning.
- **AI Opponent**: Replace Player O with a simple or advanced algorithm.
- **Animations**: Animate the appearing marks or highlight the winning line.

**Congratulations!** You now have a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game in JavaScript—no HTML or CSS details needed here. If you have more ideas to expand this project, feel free to build upon the provided logic.
